# ONE MINUTE PITCH

This is an application that allows users to use that one minute wisely. The users will submit their one minute pitches and other users will vote on them and leave comments to give their feedback on them.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
As a user:

* You will see various categories of the pitches but you first need to sign up for an account with a valid email address and password.
* Some of the categories include:
  * Pick up lines 
  * jokes
  * Interview pitch
  * Product pitch

* You can select a category of which you would like to view.

* Still you can add a category of your choice and write a pitch to it.
